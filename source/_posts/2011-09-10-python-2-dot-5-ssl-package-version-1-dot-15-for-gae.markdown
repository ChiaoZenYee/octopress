In Windows platform, most quickly way to building up the Google App Engine SDK is install <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads/thank-you?dl=http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePython/releases/2.5.6.10/ActivePython-2.5.6.10-win32-x86.msi" target="_blank">ActiveStates Python 2.5.6.10</a> and the MSI version of <a href="http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/GoogleAppEngine-1.5.3.msi">GoogleAppEngine 1.5.3</a>.

But after you finish installation and get ready to deploy your first application, you will got the very annoy error which require SSL module for python, it is very hard to find such SSL module in internet as most of the links is source code code and require you build SSL by yourself in a C++ VS2003/MingW environment.

So I just upload a version in <a href="http://115.com/file/dnhbixkn#ssl-1.15.win32-py2.5.zip" target="_blank">115 disk</a> for you download. (yes, binary version so you have to trust me there is no problem...)
