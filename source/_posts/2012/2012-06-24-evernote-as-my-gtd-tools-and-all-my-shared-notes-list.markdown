<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">GTD is a new cult for the info age</a>, so I just starting using Evernote today as my GTD tools, I also share a <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/ecguo/rails" target="_blank">rails tech notes</a> as start, maybe latter, I will share more notes, but please notices those notes is not well written compare to my blogs, it's become public just because I think I should be an open mind person.

All public Evernote:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/ecguo/rails" target="_blank">Ruby &amp; Rails</a></li>
</ul>
