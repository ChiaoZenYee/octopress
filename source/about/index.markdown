I'm a software engineer living in Shanghai China.

I'm working for a S&P and Fortune 500 Semi-conductor company, focus on MES (Manufacturing Execution System) in .NET platform, but in my spare time, I spend quite a lot of time on open source language like Ruby and Python and believe that the cloud based MES system will replace the internal MES system within 10 years.
